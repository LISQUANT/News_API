SENTIMENT SCORE (-1.0 to 1.0)\nProvide a precise, weighted sentiment score considering:\n\nSCORING GUIDE:\n  -1.0 = Catastrophic (bankruptcy, fraud, criminal charges, existential threats)\n  -0.75 = Severely negative (major losses, failed products, leadership crisis, significant downgrades)\n  -0.5 = Negative (missed earnings, declining sales, lost contracts, weak guidance)\n  -0.25 = Slightly negative (minor setbacks, small concerns, cautious outlook)\n   0.0 = Neutral (mixed signals, no clear directional impact)\n  +0.25 = Slightly positive (minor improvements, small wins, positive mentions)\n  +0.5 = Positive (beat earnings, new contracts, growth, analyst upgrades)\n  +0.75 = Very positive (major breakthroughs, significant partnerships, strong guidance)\n  +1.0 = Exceptional (transformative deals, revolutionary products, game-changing events)\n\nWEIGHTING FACTORS - Adjust your score based on:\n\nA) TIME SENSITIVITY (Critical - weight heavily!):\n   - Breaking news (< 6 hours): High impact, maximum weight\n   - Recent (6-24 hours): High impact, significant weight\n   - Today (24-48 hours): Moderate impact\n   - This week (2-7 days): Lower immediate impact\n   - Older news (> 7 days): Minimal immediate impact unless new developments\n   NOTE: Older news should be scored lower unless it's developing/ongoing\n\nB) SOURCE CREDIBILITY:\n   Tier 1 (High credibility, weight +0.2): Official company announcements, SEC filings, earnings reports, Bloomberg, Reuters, WSJ, Financial Times, major analyst firms\n   Tier 2 (Medium credibility, weight 0.0): CNBC, MarketWatch, Yahoo Finance, Business Insider, established trade publications\n   Tier 3 (Lower credibility, weight -0.1): Social media, rumors, unverified sources, opinion blogs\n   NOTE: Adjust sentiment confidence based on source tier\n\nC) FACT vs RUMOR:\n   - Confirmed facts (official statements, data releases): Full weight\n   - \"Sources say\"/\"According to insiders\": Reduce weight by 30%\n   - Speculation/Analysis: Reduce weight by 50%\n   - Unverified rumors: Reduce weight by 70%\n\nD) MARKET EXPECTATIONS CONTEXT:\n   - Did it beat/miss expectations? By how much?\n   - Was this anticipated or a surprise?\n   - \"Good news\" that was expected = lower positive impact\n   - \"Bad news\" that was expected = lower negative impact\n   - Surprise factor amplifies the sentiment\n\nE) COMPETITOR & SECTOR IMPACT:\n   - If company loses market share → who gains?\n   - Industry-wide trends vs company-specific\n   - Zero-sum game scenarios (one company's loss = another's gain)\n   - Identify correlated stocks affected\n\n## 2.
